# Intro to programming in Processing

## Structure

* setup() -- this happens once at the beginning
* draw()  -- this loops continuously forever

## Drawing functions

* size(w, h)          -- set the width and height of the screen
* background(r, g, b) -- colours in the background
* fill(r, g, b)       -- sets the colour to fill shapes with
* stroke(r, g, b)     -- sets the colour to border shapes with
* rect(x, y, w, h)    -- draws a rectangle
* ellipse(x, y, w, h) -- draws an ellipse

## Getting stuff moving

* define a variable for the position of your shape
* update the variable in the draw loop each time

## Challenge

* 4 shapes
* each shape has a different colour
* each shape moves in a different direction
* each shape moves at a different speed
